I attended the Istituto Tecnico Commerciale "Cesare Pavese" in **Caserta** and shortly after I started my career in Information Technology.

After some short experiences in small realities assembling computers and connecting modem & people Internet, I got the chance for a short enterprise experience during the draft (at the Italian Air Force). 

I started first in a **Consultancy Company** based in **Rome** in **2001** and since **2006** I work on **Cassa depositi e prestiti** where I am now the **Head of the ICT Sourcing & Portfolio** Business Unit, of course in the **Information & Communication Technology Area**.

In these years in CDP I have dealt with **Technical Operations**, Users **Support Services**,  **Digital & Transformation** Projects, **Innovation** & **Strategy**. 

In parallel I deepened the business competence especially in **Sustainability**, **Finance** and **Banking** Sector. 

I am passionate about **Emerging Technology** and how they can **evolve the way we work** and collaborate. 

My hobbies range from **Photography** or **Video** editing to powerful **Cars** and comfortable **Motorcycles**. I like old **Cinema**, new **TV Series**, Online Multiplayer **Videogames** and of course being on the **sofa** for hours.

I experience the use of **Home Automation**, **Programming**, **Artificial Intelligence** and **Analytics** for fun.
