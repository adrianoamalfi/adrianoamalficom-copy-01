I attended the Istituto Tecnico Commerciale "Cesare Pavese" in Caserta and shortly after I started my career in Information Technology.

After some short experiences in small realities assembling computers and connecting modem & people to 32Kbit Internet, I got the chance for a short enterprise experience during the draft (at the Italian Air Force). 

I started first in a Consultancy Company based in Rome in 2001 and since 2006 I work on CDP where I am now the Head of the ICT Sourcing & Portfolio Unit, of course in the Information & Communication Technology Area.

In these years in CDP I have dealt with IT Operations, End Users Services & Support, ICT Transformation Projects and I deepened the business issues especially in finance and banking. 

I am passionate about emerging technology and how they can help the way we work and collaborate. 

My hobbies range from photography or video editing to powerful cars and comfortable motorcycles. I like old cinema, new tv series, friend-private multi-player videogames and of course being on the sofa for hours.

I experience the use of Home Automation, Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis for fun.
